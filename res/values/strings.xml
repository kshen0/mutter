	<string name="lipsum">Cornelia Hancock (1840–1927), from a New Jersey Quaker family, was inspired by the service of her brother and cousins. She tried to volunteer as a nurse, but was rejected because of her youth (she was only 23 years old).  Still, she traveled on to Gettysburg, arriving on July 6, 1863, the third day after the battle. Later, she described the scene: 
\n\n\n
\tA long table stood in [the] woods…and around it gathered a number of surgeons and attendants. This was the operating table, and for seven days it literally ran blood. A wagon stood near rapidly filling with amputated arms and legs; when wholly filled, this gruesome spectacle withdrew from sight and returned as soon as possible for another load. … Every barn, church, and building of any size in Gettysburg had been converted into a temporary hospital.
\n\n
\tWe went the same evening to one of the churches, where I saw for the first time what war meant. Hundreds of desperately wounded men were stretched out on boards laid across the high-backed pews as closely as they could be packed together. The boards were covered with straw. Thus elevated, these poor sufferers’ faces, white and drawn with pain, were almost on a level with my own. I seemed to stand breast-high in a sea of anguish. … As we made our way…to the Field Hospital, the first sight that met our eyes was a collection of semi-conscious but still living human forms, all of whom had been shot through the head, and were considered hopeless. They were laid there to die and I hoped that they were indeed too near death to have consciousness. Yet many a groan came from them, and their limbs tossed and twitched.

	<string name="h1">At the outbreak of the war the United States Surgeon General\'s office consisted of a total of 115 surgeons; 24 of these resigned to form the nucleus of the Confederate medical services. Eventually both services were vastly-but quite inadequately-expanded. Nursing services, too, were primitive.</string>
	<string name="h2"> The army still relied on male nurses, most of them quite untrained. At the outbreak of the war the famous humanitarian, Dorothea Dix, hurried to Washington to offer her services; she was appointed Superintendent of Women Nurses, but never allowed any real independence.</string>

	<string name="blacksoldiers">By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war—30,000 of infection or disease. Black soldiers served in artillery and infantry and performed all noncombat support functions that sustain an army, as well. Black carpenters, chaplains, cooks, guards, laborers, nurses, scouts, spies, steamboat pilots, surgeons, and teamsters also contributed to the war cause. There were nearly 80 black commissioned officers. Black women, who could not formally join the Army, nonetheless served as nurses, spies, and scouts, the most famous being Harriet Tubman (photo citation: 200-HN-PIO-1), who scouted for the 2d South Carolina Volunteers.</string>
	<string name="manleystacey">Manley Stacey, a mechanic from Lyons, New York, was a corporal in the 111th New York Volunteer Infantry. These selections are from a long letter he wrote to his father during the battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863. Stacey survived the battle, but was accidentally shot and killed six months later, in December of 1863. He was 21 years old.

\tWhen we camped last, we could see the wounded coming in, those that were able to walk, and the cavalry horses coming in riderless. This showed us that something was going on... I think this will be an awful battle very soon and of course we are in for it... It is a sad sight to see the wounded brought in on stretchers, the poor boys all covered with blood and as pale as death.
\n\n
\tLast night at 4 PM we were ordered to march and form in Line of battle on our left. After a great deal of confusion, we got formed and then we were ordered to advance, right in the face of the rebel guns who were firing their grape and canisters into us by wholesale... After a great deal of marching and counter marching, we were ordered to charge on a rebel battery. We were now right in front of our canons, advancing on their guns, the rebel sharpshooters in our rear picking off our officers. This was an awful time the shells taking the men down by ranks. While we were marching, a man was shot, and the Blood was spilling all over my face, it perfectly Blinded me.
\n\n
\tAt 1 PM we were shelled by 100 guns, all concentrated on the force supporting the battery. There we laid behind a stone wall, the shells passing over us and killing the men all around me. Three men were killed and thrown across me, covering me with blood. While we were laying here, a shell struck a stone in the wall and killed a man throwing the man across my legs and the stone striking me in the back and doubling me up.
\n\n
\tWe have got about 18 men now in the Company fit for duty and 150 in the Regiment. We went in the fight with over 400, and have yet now 150.
